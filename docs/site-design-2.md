Below is a proposed end-to-end website design for Loshan.music—drawing visual inspiration from Sabrina Carpenter’s site and using the https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/2956 template. The goal is to create a bold, modern aesthetic that highlights Lashon’s artistry, story, and new releases. The design will utilize the best of her striking images—especially those in green dresses, backless black outfits, and the white ensemble at the piano—paired with an updated/streamlined version of her bio.
https://github.com/stefanogali/panic-panini-next is what we want to use for the home page



1. Overall Style & Branding

Color Palette
	•	Deep Emerald Green & Gold for accents, mirroring the “Moolah” cover art and the green dress shoot.
	•	Black and Charcoal Gray as primary backgrounds or text, giving a sleek, modern feel (akin to Sabrina Carpenter’s site).
	•	White / Off-White text or backgrounds for contrast in sections (especially behind large images or hero banners).

Typography
	•	A clean, bold sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat or Bebas Neue) for prominent headlines, echoing the big-block style often seen on Sabrina Carpenter’s landing page.
	•	A more neutral sans-serif (e.g., Lato, Open Sans) for body text and smaller headings, ensuring legibility on all devices.

Imagery & Layout
	•	Use full-width images or large, horizontally oriented “strips” to showcase Lashon in her various looks:
	•	The teal/gold environment (for “Moolah”)
	•	Backless black dress images (chic editorial vibe)
	•	The white piano shoot (elevated, refined aesthetic)
	•	The microphone / studio image (artistic, performing energy)
	•	Where possible, incorporate short text overlays with calls to action.

	•	A minimal top navigation (logo/title on the left, menu items right-aligned):
	1.	Home
	2.	About
	3.	Music
	4.	Gallery
	5.	Contact

1. Home Page
	1.	Hero Section
	•	Featured Image/Slideshow:
	•	Option 1: Large, full-width shot of Lashon in the emerald green gown on the gold couch (it’s visually similar in “pop” to Sabrina Carpenter’s site’s hero).
	•	Option 2: A slideshow cycling between the green dress shot, the black backless dress shot, and the white piano shot.
	•	Minimal Text Overlay:
	•	Large text: LASHON (in bold sans-serif).
	•	Smaller text/descriptor: Hip-Hop • R&B • Soul or “Miami-Born. New York-Trained. Ready to Rise.”
	•	Primary CTA: “Explore My Music” (scrolls down to the Music section or links to the Music page).
	2.	New Release Highlight
	•	Directly beneath the hero, display Lashon’s latest release in a horizontally oriented “strip.”
	•	Image: Use the “Moolah” cover (the teal background with “MOOLAH” spelled out and Lashon in a matching gown).
	•	Text: “New Single Out Now: MOOLAH” or “Get Your Money Right with MOOLAH—Listen Now!”
	•	CTA: “Listen Now” linking to streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.).
	3.	About Preview
	•	A small text box or two- to three-sentence excerpt from her revised bio:
	“From MVP athlete to underground rap champion, Lashon has never followed the traditional path. Now, she’s fusing hip-hop, R&B, and soul to make her mark on the music world.”
	•	CTA: “Read My Story” → takes users to the About page.
	4.	Visual Teaser / Collage
	•	A row or mosaic of 2–4 images (like the black backless dress, white piano shot, or the microphone performance) to showcase her style.
	•	Possibly with hover effects (title or short tagline on hover).
	5.	Mailing List / Newsletter (Optional)
	•	A simple sign-up box if Lashon wants to build a fan community:
	•	“Join the Inner Circle. Be the first to hear about new music and shows.”
	•	Email field + “Sign Up” button.

2. About Page
	1.	Hero Image
	•	Full-width banner of Lashon with a slightly more personal, warm vibe, e.g., the studio shot singing in the yellow dress or something with a performance feel to emphasize her artistic side.
	•	Large heading: “Meet Lashon” or “About Lashon.”
	2.	Bio Text (Condensed & Polished)
Use a more concise version of the provided copy to keep it web-friendly. For example:
	From Miami Courts to NYC Stages
Lashon Thomas, a dynamic hip-hop, R&B, and soul artist, found her passion for music after an accomplished athletic career—15 MVP awards and a spot in the Elite Youth Basketball League. Despite her success on the court, she felt drawn to the arts and pursued theatre at Florida A&M before transferring to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York.
	It was there that she truly discovered her love for performing, but it wasn’t until 2020 that her real musical journey began. After two years of intense study—and earning underground rap championship titles—Lashon is poised for a breakthrough year in 2023. Watch her fuse her athletic drive, theater background, and musical talent into an explosive sound that’s all her own.
	3.	Supporting Photos
	•	Intermix text blocks with photos, such as the white piano shot or a candid “Moolah” shoot image, to add visual interest and break up paragraphs.
	4.	CTA or Quote
	•	Possibly end with a short, bold quote from Lashon: “Music is how I turn my story into a celebration.”
	•	Button: “Listen to My Music” or “Check Out My Latest Single.”

1. Music Page
	1.	Header / Main Banner
	•	A wide banner showcasing the “Moolah” cover or the “Woman” cover.
	•	Title: “My Music” or “Discography” in a bold, stylized font.
	2.	Featured Single / EP
	•	Large section for the newest release. If “Moolah” is the lead single, highlight that with cover art and a short snippet:
	“Feel the rhythm of ‘Moolah.’ Available on Spotify, Apple Music, and more.”
	•	CTA: “Listen Now.”
	3.	Other Releases
	•	Thumbnails or smaller image cards for any other singles like “Woman,” with each card linking to streaming platforms or a separate song detail page.
	•	If there are no additional singles yet, simply keep the page dedicated to “Moolah” with a note: “More music coming soon—stay tuned!”
	4.	Embedded Players / Videos (Optional)
	•	If Lashon has a music video or performance clip, embed a YouTube or Wix Video link.
	•	If she has a SoundCloud or Spotify track, embed the player to let visitors preview directly on the site.

2. Gallery Page
	1.	Gallery Introduction
	•	A minimal heading: “Gallery”
	•	Possibly a sub-heading: “Explore the visuals behind the music.”
	2.	Photo Collection / Mosaic
	•	Group images into sections or a grid:
	•	Fashion / Editorial: The black dress with the open back, the green gown looks, or the layered jean skirt shot from the “Woman” cover.
	•	Studio / Performance: The gold/yellow studio shot singing into the microphone.
	•	Behind-the-Scenes / Lifestyle (if available).
	•	Clickable thumbnails that open into a lightbox/slideshow, letting users browse full-size images.
	3.	Captions
	•	Optional short captions or disclaimers about each shoot.
	•	Keep the design minimal to let the images speak for themselves.

3. Contact Page
	1.	Contact Form
	•	Simple and straightforward: Name, Email, Message.
	•	CTA: “Send” or “Reach Out.”
	•	Sub-header: “For bookings, collaborations, or just to say hello—drop a note below.”
	2.	Direct Email Link
	•	If you have a dedicated business email, list it here.
	3.	Social Media Links
	•	Icons linking to Lashon’s socials (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.).
	•	Possibly an embedded Instagram feed that auto-updates.

Refined Copy Example

Below is an example you can adapt directly into the site (feel free to adjust wording as needed):

	Hero Text
Lashon
Hip-Hop • R&B • Soul
“Moolah” Out Now

	About Teaser
“I’m Lashon—Miami-born, New York-trained, and here to bring my story to life through music. Ready to witness raw talent, unstoppable drive, and a love for performance that knows no limits?”

	Short Bio Snippet (On About Page)
“I grew up on the basketball court, earning 15 MVP titles and a place in the Elite Youth Basketball League. But my heart was always in the arts. After studying theater at FAMU and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, I discovered my true love for writing and performing music. Now, I’m blending hip-hop, R&B, and soul into a sound that’s uniquely mine. Join me as I take my next bold step in 2023.”

Putting It All Together
	1.	Strong Visual Impact: Align the home page hero image and color scheme (greens, golds, black) to match Lashon’s brand and the “Moolah” artwork.
	2.	Clean Navigation: Keep the menu concise. Keep the site’s structure streamlined (Home, About, Music, Gallery, Contact).
	3.	Engaging Content: Display each major piece of Lashon’s story or imagery in an easy, scroll-based format—much like Sabrina Carpenter’s site, which uses big images and minimal text to keep visitors immersed in the brand.
	4.	CTA Flow: Encourage listening to music, reading about Lashon’s background, and contacting for bookings or following on socials.
	5.	Responsive & Mobile-Friendly: Ensure each section resizes effectively on tablets and phones, especially the hero slideshow or large background images.

By incorporating the bold editorial photos, refined copy, and an intuitive site layout, Loshan.music will give visitors an immediate sense of who Lashon is, why her music matters, and how they can follow her journey—and it will visually echo the sleek, professional style of Sabrina Carpenter’s website that inspired this design.

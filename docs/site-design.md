Concept Overview

We’ll adapt the Wix template https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/2956 to have an elegant, modern feel reminiscent of Sabrina Carpenter’s site. The site will feature lush imagery, a focus on Lashon’s story, and seamless ways to explore her music. The overall color palette should incorporate rich jewel tones (e.g. emerald green, gold, and black) paired with neutrals so that the vibrant photography takes center stage. Typography should be sleek but bold—think a minimal sans-serif for main text and a modern serif or script accent for headings.

Below is a proposed site structure, page-by-page description, and suggestions on which images/bio text to use.

1. Home Page

Hero Section
	•	Layout & Style: A full-width hero banner featuring a dynamic slideshow or a single, compelling image of Lashon.
	•	Recommended Image: The green dress shots (either the wide shot on the gold couch or the vertical shot with Lashon posing). These images immediately grab attention with their deep emerald color and the regal setting, echoing the Sabrina Carpenter site’s eye-catching hero image.
	•	Text Overlay: Large, stylish text reading “LASHON” (or “Introducing Lashon”), with a smaller tagline beneath—e.g. “Hip-Hop • R&B • Soul” or “Rising Artist from Miami”.
	•	Call-to-Action (CTA): A simple button, e.g. “Enter Site” or “Explore Music”, which scrolls down or leads to the Music section.

Featured Music / New Release
	•	Inspiration: Sabrina Carpenter’s homepage highlights her latest release prominently.
	•	Placement: Right below the hero, a horizontal “strip” or box that features Lashon’s newest single or EP (you can label it “Moolah,” “Woman,” or whichever upcoming track you want to promote first).
	•	Image & Copy:
	•	Use the “Moolah” cover shot (the teal/gold environment with “MOOLAH” behind Lashon).
	•	Text snippet: “Listen to my new single, Moolah—available now on all streaming platforms.”
	•	CTA: “Listen Now” linking to streaming platforms.

About Teaser
	•	A short excerpt of Lashon’s story (two or three sentences) that encourages people to read more.
	•	Example: “Miami-born artist Lashon fuses hip-hop, R&B, and soul into a powerful performance style. Once an elite athlete, Lashon has found her true calling in music—turning her passion into a breakout career.”
	•	A “Learn More” button linking to the full About page.

Heroic Imagery / Promo Section
	•	You could include a “tiled” or “masonry” layout of the high-fashion photos (like the backless black dress pictures, or the white outfit by the piano) to showcase Lashon’s unique style and brand.

Newsletter Signup (Optional)
	•	A subtle sign-up form (if you want to build an email list), with a short note: “Be the first to know about new music, events, and exclusive content.”

Mobile Considerations
	•	Ensure the hero image scales for mobile devices. The “Featured Music” strip can become a vertical section on phones, with the single’s artwork up top and the CTA below.

2. About Page

Page Intro
	•	Large heading: “Meet Lashon” or “About Lashon”
	•	A signature photo at the top or set as a background banner (e.g. the glamorous shot in the recording studio wearing the gold dress, microphone in hand, to emphasize she’s a performing artist).

Bio Text
	•	Reworked & Streamlined Version of the provided bio (to keep it web-friendly). For example:

	Miami Roots & An Unstoppable Drive
From her MVP-winning days on the basketball court to her discovery of a deep passion for performing, Lashon’s journey has been anything but ordinary. Growing up in Miami, Florida, she excelled in athletics and competed in the Elite Youth Basketball League (EYBL) before pursuing theatre at Florida A&M University. But her true calling emerged in 2020, when she poured her heart into writing and performing music.

	Now, in 2023, Lashon is stepping into the spotlight as a hip-hop, R&B, and soul artist. Having honed her craft through countless underground performances and rap battles, she’s ready to share her voice with the world. Watch as this rising star turns her passion into an unstoppable force in music.

	•	You can tweak or shorten further, but maintain the essence of her story.

Additional Photos or Sections
	•	Use a small gallery or single hero image to break up text paragraphs (perhaps the white piano shot or an athletic-themed shot if you have one).
	•	End with a CTA like: “Listen to the Music” or “Get in Touch for Booking” leading to relevant pages.

3. Music Page

Header & Layout
	•	A simple heading: “Music” or “Discography”.
	•	Big promo for the latest release, same “Moolah” image, or the “Woman” single artwork.
	•	Include embedded players if you have tracks available (Spotify, SoundCloud, Apple Music) or a placeholder to add them later.

Singles / EP / Albums Listing
	•	Grid or list of Lashon’s releases with quick links to major streaming services.
	•	You could reuse the “Moolah” cover, “Woman” cover, or any other single/EP covers.

Music Videos
	•	If Lashon has official music videos or performance videos, embed or link them here.
	•	You could highlight the studio shot with the microphone as a still preview for a music video.

4. Gallery / Photos Page

Concept
	•	Showcases Lashon’s style and brand with large, high-resolution images.
	•	You can create separate sections or a single mosaic for:
	1.	Fashion Shoots (the backless black dress, the green velvet couch, the white piano shot).
	2.	Live Performances / In-Studio (the bright yellow outfit singing into the mic).
	3.	Behind the Scenes (if any casual or candid images exist).

Presentation
	•	Employ Wix’s built-in galleries or strips with parallax scrolling.
	•	Each image can expand in a lightbox for a closer look.

5. Live / Events Page (Optional)

Purpose
	•	If Lashon plans to perform or do public appearances, create an “Events” or “Live” page.
	•	List upcoming shows or appearances, with ticket links if applicable.

Layout
	•	Simple chronological list or a dynamic calendar.
	•	Show a featured photo (maybe the microphone shot or a captivating stage-like shot) as a background.

6. Contact / Bookings Page

Contact Form
	•	Basic form for business or fan inquiries.
	•	Link to a manager or booking agent email if available.

Social Media Links
	•	Icons or clickable links to Lashon’s social media—Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, etc.
	•	Possibly embed an Instagram feed to maintain a fresh, always-updating visual.

7. Store / Merch Page (Future Option)
	•	If Lashon sells merch, we can add a “Shop” page integrated with Wix’s store features.
	•	Display product images, sizing, and checkout options.

Overall Visual & Design Notes
	1.	Color Palette: Emphasize emerald greens, gold accents, black, and white/gray neutrals. This complements Lashon’s fashion shots and matches the vibe of the teal/gold environment in the “Moolah” cover.
	2.	Typography:
	•	A bold, modern sans-serif for headings (e.g. Montserrat, Bebas Neue, or something similarly crisp).
	•	A simple, clean sans-serif (e.g. Open Sans, Lato) for body text.
	3.	Navigation Bar:
	•	Keep it minimal: Home | Music | About | Gallery | Contact (and “Live/Events” or “Store” if needed).
	•	Possibly feature Lashon’s name/logo on the left and the menu links on the right.
	4.	Animations: Subtle fade-ins or slide-in transitions to give a dynamic feel but keep load times quick.
	5.	Responsiveness: Ensure images and text adapt well on mobile. Possibly use one strong vertical image on smaller screens instead of complex sliders.

Final Copy Suggestions

Feel free to modify the about text or any headings to match your branding tone. For instance, you could lead with a more personal approach:

	“I’m Lashon—Miami-born, New York-trained, and driven by the power of hip-hop, R&B, and soul. My journey has taken me from basketball courts to theatrical stages, and now, to the studio mic. Get ready for a new wave of energy and passion in 2023. I can’t wait to share my story—and my music—with you.”

Incorporate short, bold statements on the homepage or music pages, e.g. “Where rhythm meets soul, that’s where you’ll find Lashon.”

Putting It All Together

By merging the sleek feel of the https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/2956, the inspiring aesthetic of Sabrina Carpenter’s site, and the bold, fashionable visuals from Lashon’s photos, we’ll produce a site that:
	•	Immediately showcases Lashon’s personality and style through vibrant hero images.
	•	Spotlights her music with prominent CTAs and embedded streaming.
	•	Shares her backstory in a concise, compelling way.
	•	Provides a visually immersive gallery for fans and industry professionals to explore.
	•	Invites engagement via sign-up forms, social links, and a contact page for bookings.

This design will serve as a powerful platform to introduce Lashon to the world and align visually with her dynamic musical persona.

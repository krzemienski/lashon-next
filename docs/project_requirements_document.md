# Project Requirements Document: Lashon.Music Website

## 1. Project Overview

Lashon.Music is an end-to-end website built to showcase Lashon’s artistry, story, and musical releases in a visually striking and modern way. Drawing inspiration from Sabrina Carpenter’s website and using Wix Template #2956, the site will feature bold imagery—such as high-quality photos of Lashon in a green dress, backless black outfit, and a refined white piano ensemble—to communicate a strong, artistic brand identity. The design emphasizes a clean, editorial style that uses deep emerald green, gold accents, black backgrounds, and off-white contrast to create a unique aesthetic that reflects both energy and sophistication.

The site is being built to increase engagement with Lashon’s music, expand her fan base, and facilitate connections for potential collaborations. Key success criteria include strong visual impact, intuitive navigation, clear calls-to-action (like “Listen Now” and newsletter sign-ups), and seamless integration with streaming platforms and social media channels. Ultimately, this website will act as both a portfolio and a hub for fans to explore her music, learn about her journey, and connect directly through contact forms or social media links.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   A multi-page website comprising Home, About, Music, Gallery, and Contact pages.
*   High-quality, full-width images and multimedia integration showcasing Lashon’s different looks.
*   A design following a bold, modern aesthetic with a color palette of deep emerald green, gold accents, black/charcoal, and off-white.
*   Responsive layout and mobile-friendly design using Wix Template #2956.
*   Clear navigation with minimal top navigation (Home, About, Music, Gallery, Contact).
*   Integrated CTAs for streaming music directly via Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube links.
*   Newsletter signup integration using tools like Mailchimp or Constant Contact.
*   Social media embeds/links (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.) and Google Analytics for tracking.
*   Placeholder future-ready design for additional pages (Events and Store) that can be added later.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Advanced functionalities such as an interactive blog or fan forum for user-generated content.
*   Direct music downloads from the website.
*   Custom development for e-commerce; future merchandising would be handled using Wix’s store functionality once finalized.
*   Heavy backend customizations; the project will mainly utilize Wix’s tools along with integrated third-party services.
*   Extensive animation or transition effects beyond what is achievable through Wix’s standard capabilities.

## 3. User Flow

A typical visitor arrives at the Lashon.Music homepage, greeted by a dynamic full-width hero image or a slideshow showcasing Lashon in her signature styles. They see bold headline text ("LASHON” with a subheading indicating her music genres) and a strong call-to-action, such as “Explore My Music.” Below the hero, a dedicated section highlights the latest release ("Moolah") with an engaging image, textual prompt, and a button that directs them to streaming platforms. Visitors can easily scroll down for an “About Teaser” that briefly describes Lashon’s journey, accompanied by a button linking to the About page for more in-depth background information.

From the homepage, users navigate using a minimal top navigation menu to reach the About, Music, Gallery, and Contact pages. On the About page, they read a concise yet compelling biography with interspersed images, gaining insight into her background and artistic evolution. The Music page showcases her releases with large cover images and embedded streaming links while the Gallery page provides a visually appealing mosaic of her photos. Finally, the Contact page offers a straightforward form for inquiries and includes direct links to her social media channels, making it easy for fans or potential collaborators to reach out.

    *   Fast load times, with response times ideally under 2-3 seconds, especially on image-heavy pages.
    *   Optimized image sizes to balance quality and performance.

*   **Security:**

    *   Secure integration with third-party services (streaming, mail signup) using HTTPS.

*   **Usability:**

    *   Intuitive navigation and consistent design elements across pages.
    *   Mobile-friendly layout ensuring seamless interactions on tablets and smartphones.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**

    *   The project will be built on Wix, which may limit some backend customizations.
    *   Reliance on third-party services (streaming APIs, Mailchimp, Google Analytics), which might have rate limits or downtime.
    *   The design and implementation are constrained to visual and interaction capabilities offered by Wix Template #2956.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   High-quality images (green dress, backless black, white piano, etc.) and finalized text content are ready or will be supplied in a timely manner.
    *   Lashon’s social media channels and streaming service pages are active and ready to be linked.
    *   The website’s design may need to be easily expandable for future pages like Events or Store, hence the need for a flexible navigation and layout.
    *   The project expects future integrations with email marketing tools and analytic services, so the design must support embedding and linking without major overhauls.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits & Third-Party Dependencies:**

    *   Streaming platforms and email marketing tools may impose API rate limits or downtime. It is advisable to monitor these integrations and have fallback links in place.

*   **Image Optimization:**

    *   High-resolution images can slow down page load times on mobile devices. Care should be taken to optimize images for web use without compromising visual quality.

*   **Responsive Design Challenges:**

    *   Ensuring all pages (especially image-rich Home and Gallery pages) display flawlessly on all devices might require thorough testing across various screen sizes.

*   **Future Expansion:**

    *   Although future pages (Events, Store) are out-of-scope initially, the design should be modular enough to integrate these smoothly later. Pre-planning for additional navigation items and page layouts may reduce future redevelopment work.

*   **Content Updates:**

    *   Regular updates to music releases, news, and gallery images must be managed easily. Leveraging Wix’s native content management features can help, but might need periodic manual updates to maintain consistency and performance.

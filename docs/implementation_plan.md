**Phase 1: Environment Setup**

1.  Set up a Wix account and select Wix Template https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/2956 as the base for the site. (Reference: PRD Section 2 & Tech Stack)
2.  Create a new project in Wix and name it “Lashon.Music”. Organize site pages in the Wix Editor: Home, About, Music, Gallery, and Contact, leaving placeholders for future pages (Events, Store). (Reference: PRD Section 2, 7)
3.  **Validation**: Log into the Wix dashboard and verify that Template https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/2956 is applied and the project structure (with all pages listed) is visible.

**Phase 2: Frontend Development – Home Page**

1.  In Wix Editor, edit the Home page.

    *   Add a top navigation bar with the site logo/text “LASHON.MUSIC” on the left and menu items (Home, About, Music, Gallery, Contact) right-aligned. (Reference: PRD Section 1, Navigation)
    *   Create a full-width Hero Section with either a static image or a slideshow that rotates between high-quality images (Lashon in the emerald green dress, backless black dress, white piano shot). Add a dark overlay.
    *   Overlay Text: Add large bold text “LASHON” and a subheading “Hip-Hop • R&B • Soul”.
    *   Insert a CTA button labeled “Explore My Music” that scrolls or links to the Music section/page. (Reference: PRD Section 1, Home Page Mockup)

2.  **Validation**: Preview the Home page in Wix Editor; the hero image (or slideshow) should display full-width and the text/CTA must be visible.

3.  Below the Hero Section, add a horizontal strip featuring the latest release:

    *   Insert a large image placeholder for the “Moolah” cover.
    *   Add text: Either "New Single Out Now: MOOLAH" or "Get Your Money Right with MOOLAH—Listen Now!".

    *   Insert a text box with a 2-3 sentence excerpt from Lashon’s bio. (Reference: PRD Section 1, About Preview)
    *   Insert a CTA button labeled "Read My Story" linking to the About page.

6.  **Validation**: Verify that the teaser text appears correctly and the CTA navigates to the About page.

7.  Create an Image Collage Section (using Wix’s gallery layout) to display 2–3 smaller images of Lashon (backless black dress, white piano shot, etc.). (Reference: PRD Section 1, Imagery & Layout)

8.  **Validation**: Hover over images to ensure that any added hover effects (title/tagline) are visible.

**Phase 3: Frontend Development – About Page**

1.  Create and design the About page in Wix Editor.

    *   Add a full-width Hero Banner at the top using a personal performance image (e.g., studio shot with a warm vibe; possibly Lashon singing in a yellow dress). (Reference: PRD Section 2, About Page Mockup)

2.  Insert a large heading titled "Meet Lashon" (or "About Lashon").

    *   On the left (or in a side-by-side layout), add the concise biography text describing her journey from MVP athlete to music artist. (Reference: PRD Section 2, About Page Content)

3.  Insert supporting photos alongside the text (e.g., the white piano shot) to break up text and add visual interest. (Reference: PRD Section 2, Supporting Photos)

4.  Add a CTA at the bottom of the bio section, for example, a button labeled "Discover My Music" linking to the Music page. (Reference: PRD Section 2, CTA or Quote)

**Phase 4: Frontend Development – Music Page**

1.  Create the Music page using Wix Editor.

    *   Add a header/banner section with a wide image (possibly the “Moolah” cover or another strong visual) along with overlay text "My Music". (Reference: PRD Section 3, Music Page Mockup)

2.  Create a Featured Single Section:

    *   Insert a large cover image for “Moolah”.
    *   Add descriptive text such as "Check out my latest single, Moolah. Available now!".
    *   Insert a CTA button labeled "LISTEN NOW" linking to streaming services (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube). (Reference: PRD Section 3, Featured Single / EP)

3.  (Optional) Add a section for additional releases:

    *   Insert smaller thumbnail images (e.g., for “Woman”) with brief text and links to respective streaming platforms.

4.  (Optional) Embed music players or video content using Wix’s HTML iframe widget for direct previews. (Reference: PRD Section 3, Embedded Players / Videos)

    *   Add a header with the text "Gallery" and a subheader "Explore Lashon's World". (Reference: PRD Section 4, Gallery Page Mockup)

2.  Upload and arrange high-resolution images in a mosaic/grid layout (include the green dress shoot, backless black portrait, white piano shot, etc.).

3.  Enable lightbox functionality so that clicking on a thumbnail opens a larger version of each image with minimal captions. (Reference: PRD Section 4, Photo Collection / Mosaic)

4.  **Validation**: Test each image’s lightbox in the preview mode and check responsiveness on mobile devices.

**Phase 6: Frontend Development – Contact Page**

1.  Create the Contact page using Wix Editor.

    *   Insert a banner/header section with either a simple background (pattern or color scheme matching brand colors) and a title "Get in Touch". (Reference: PRD Section 5, Contact Page Mockup)

6.  **Validation**: Submit a test message through the form in preview mode and check that social media links navigate correctly.

**Phase 7: Integration & Responsive Adjustments**

1.  Verify navigation across all pages (ensure top navigation is consistent and links work). (Reference: PRD Section 1 & 7)
2.  Use Wix’s mobile editor to adjust and test responsiveness on mobile and tablet views for each page. (Reference: PRD Section 6, Usability)
3.  Ensure that all embedded content (streaming players, forms, galleries) function correctly across devices.
4.  **Validation**: Preview the entire site in desktop and mobile modes, checking for any layout issues.

**Phase 8: Third-Party Integrations & Deployment**

1.  Integrate Google Analytics into the Wix website via the Wix Dashboard (Settings → Tracking & Analytics). (Reference: PRD Section 5, Tech Stack)

2.  Set up and integrate Mailchimp (or Constant Contact) with the newsletter sign-up form to capture subscriber emails. (Reference: PRD Section 5, Newsletter Signup)

3.  **Validation**: Confirm that analytics data begins to capture visit metrics and test newsletter sign-up submissions.

4.  Final Review & Publish the Website:

    *   Review the site for overall design consistency, navigation flow, and content accuracy (ensuring branding colors, typography, and imagery are cohesive: deep emerald green, gold accents, black/charcoal, off-white backgrounds). (Reference: PRD Section 1, Overall Style & Branding)
    *   Publish the site through Wix and perform end-to-end tests, ensuring all CTAs (e.g., streaming links, navigation, contact form) function correctly.

**Phase 9: Post-Launch**

1.  Monitor site performance using Google Analytics and adjust image sizes or layout elements if load times exceed 2-3 seconds. (Reference: PRD Section 6, Performance)
2.  Periodically review email campaign results from Mailchimp/Constant Contact and iterate on the website content based on user engagement and feedback. (Reference: PRD Section 7, Future Expansion)
3.  Plan for future integration of additional pages (Events, Store) by ensuring that the top navigation and overall design remain modular and easily expandable. (Reference: PRD Section 2, In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope)

**Validation**: After post-launch adjustments, simulate user interactions through multiple devices and browsers to confirm the site meets design and functionality requirements.

This step-by-step implementation plan is designed to meet the requirements outlined in the PRD for Lashon.Music, ensuring a responsive, visually striking, and user-friendly website built on Wix Template https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/2956.
